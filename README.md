Knave's Elemental Pearls: Minecraft datapack for more pearl types

**Minecraft Version 1.15.2**

This in-progress Minecraft data pack adds 14 new types of pearls alongside the current ender pearl.

There are pearls across 5 elemental types: Fire, Air, Ice, Stone, and Ender.

There are three flavors of pearls: the basic pearl, a "Greater" flavor, and an "Ultimate" flavor.

## How to Craft
Step 1: Construct an energy frame by throwing an item frame, redstone, and quartz on the ground.

Step 2: Place a dropper **face up** and place the energy frame on this dropper.

Step 3: Place an ender pearl in the energy frame, the dropper should transform into a **Pearl Combinator**

Step 4: Use the Pearl Combinator to craft the elemental pearls. Currently only the standard pearls are craftable, recipes for the Greater and Ultimate versions to follow:

Fire Pearl: lapiz in the corners, with fire charges surrounding a stack of eight ender pearls in the middle

Air Pearl: lapiz in the corners, with feathers surrounding a stack of eight ender pearls in the middle

Ice Pearl: lapiz in the corners, with ice blocks surrounding a stack of eight ender pearls in the middle

Stone Pearl: lapiz in the corners, with stone blocks surrounding a stack of eight ender pearls in the middle
