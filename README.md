# Knave's Elemental Pearls
**Minecraft Version 1.15.2**

This in-progress Minecraft data pack adds *14 new types* of pearls alongside the current ender pearl. There are pearls across 5 elemental types: Fire, Air, Ice, Stone, and Ender.

There are three flavors of pearls: the basic pearl, a "Greater" flavor which offers greater utility and power, and a devastating  "Ultimate" variant with spectacular (vanilla-friendly) effects.

## Installing the Data Pack
Download the zip file of the latest datapack release. The zip file will contain two folders, a **knv-elemental** folder which is the actual datapack, and a **knv-elemental_Textures** folder which is the optional resource pack for the pearls. 

First ensure you have created and saved new world in Minecraft. After this is done, browse to your **.minecraft** folder and find the saves directory. Open the folder for the world you just created, and you will find the **datapacks** directory. Drop the **knv-elemental** folder in this directory and you are good to go!

It is highly recommended to add the custom resource pack to make the elemental pearls and items look their best - also in the **.minecraft** folder is the **resourcepacks** directory, here you will need to drop the **knv-elemental_Textures** folder. Add the resourcepack like any normal resourcepack in-game, and you are set!

Refer to the Wiki for more detailed installation instructions.

## Types of Pearls
There are 14 new types of pearls added by this datapack. There are 3 types of pearls for each element (Fire, Air, Ice, Stone). There are also 2 additional types of ender pearls.

## Acquiring Pearls In-Game
**Note:** Refer to this project's wiki for specific crafting recipes 

Before being able to craft the basic elemental pearls, you will need to get yourself an Energy Frame, constructed by throwing an item frame, redstone, and quartz on the ground. With the Energy Frame (which can also be used to generate particle effects in the world!), you can construct the **Pearl Combinator** which is what is used for all further crafting recipes with this data pack. The Pearl Combinator is constructed by placing the Energy Frame ontop of a dropper that is facing up, and placing a regular Ender Pearl in the frame.

From here, follow the provided recipes to construct the elemental pearls. The Greater and Ultimate forms of elemental pearls can only be crafted with materials that must be traded for by an Elementalist villager - you can summon one by crafting an **Elemental Totem** in the Pearl Combinator, and placing the totem near a Cleric villager. 

A short summary of the crafting recipes are below, with more detail provided in the wiki.   
**Fire Pearl**: lapiz in the corners, with fire charges surrounding a stack of eight ender pearls in the middle   
**Greater Fire Pearl**: diamond in the corners, with elemental shards surrounding a stack of eight fire pearls   
**Ultimate Fire Pearl**: elemental crystals in corners, nether star in the middle, remaining spaces have 2 greater fire pearls each
