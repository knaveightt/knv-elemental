Knave's Elemental Pearls: Minecraft datapack for more pearl types

**Minecraft Version 1.15.2**

This in-progress Minecraft data pack adds 14 new types of pearls alongside the current ender pearl.

There are pearls across 5 elemental types: Fire, Air, Ice, Stone, and Ender.

There are three flavors of pearls: the basic pearl, a "Greater" flavor, and an "Ultimate" flavor.

## How to Craft
Step 1: Construct an energy frame by throwing an item frame, redstone, and quartz on the ground.

Step 2: Place a dropper **face up** and place the energy frame on this dropper.

Step 3: Place an ender pearl in the energy frame, the dropper should transform into a **Pearl Combinator**

Step 4: Use the Pearl Combinator to craft the elemental pearls. Currently only the standard and Greater pearls are craftable, recipes for the Ultimate versions to follow:

Fire Pearl: lapiz in the corners, with fire charges surrounding a stack of eight ender pearls in the middle

Air Pearl: lapiz in the corners, with feathers surrounding a stack of eight ender pearls in the middle

Ice Pearl: lapiz in the corners, with ice blocks surrounding a stack of eight ender pearls in the middle

Stone Pearl: lapiz in the corners, with stone blocks surrounding a stack of eight ender pearls in the middle

For Greater Pearl Variants, you will need to trade for the necessary crafting material with an elementalist villager. Create an elemental totel by placing an armor stand in the middle of the Pearl Combinator, and placing a fire pearl above it, air pearl to the left, ice pearl to the right, and stone pearl below. This will create an Elemental totem which you place next to a Cleric villager to transform them to an Elementalist.

You trade with the elementalist to get Elemental Shards (there are also easy recipes for the base pearl types) which you will use to craft the below.

Greater Fire Pearl: diamond in the corners, with elemental shards surrounding a stack of eight fire pearls

Greater Air Pearl: diamond in the corners, with elemental shards surrounding a stack of eight Air pearls

Greater Ice Pearl: diamond in the corners, with elemental shards surrounding a stack of eight Ice pearls

Greater Stone Pearl: diamond in the corners, with elemental shards surrounding a stack of eight Stone pearls

Greater Ender Pearl: diamond in the corners, with elemental shards surrounding a stack of eight ender pearls
